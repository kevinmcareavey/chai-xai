# CHAI-XAI
A collection of material on explainable AI (XAI) relevant to [Cyber Hygiene in AI Enabled Domestic Life (CHAI)](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/T026812/1).

> We say that a [...] model is **interpretable** if you can inspect the actual model and understand why it got a particular answer for a given input, and how the answer would change when the input changes.
> [...]
> An **explainable** model is one that can help you understand “*why* was this output produced for this input?”
> In our terminology, interpretability derives from inspecting the actual model, whereas explainability can be provided by a separate process.
> That is, the model itself can be a hard-to-understand black box, but an explanation module can summarise what the model does.
